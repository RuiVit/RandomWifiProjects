# Wifi Lyra Installation

## How to connect two Lyra AC2200 with Ethernet cables (sorta blackhaul)

1. Setup the first Lyra as usual (via web interface or app, but don't connect/pair the second Lyra, don't even plug it in)

2. Go to the web interface and on the Administration row select > AP Mode ON < (last option)
OR http://router.asus.com/Advanced_OperationMode_Content.asp 

3. With the second Lyra plugged off connect the Ethernet Cable on the first Lyra
        (the first Lyra should by now be with a light blue color, aka totally configured) 

4. Setup the second Lyra as usual and the IP should be automaticcly assigned

5. It's a good ideia to change the network address to one above for each Lyra (first one 192.168.73.1, second 192.168.74.1, etc)
